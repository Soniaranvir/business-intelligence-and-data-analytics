1Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue & User Retention Calculation
-Computes Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Customer Retention Rate (CRR), and Churn Rate using historical transaction data.
-Uses cohort analysis to identify retention trends over time.
-Techniques: SQL, Pandas, Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation
-Applies K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to segment customers based on purchase frequency, recency, and monetary value (RFM Analysis).
-Implements Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE) for visualization.
-Techniques: Scikit-learn, K-Means++, Silhouette Score, DBSCAN.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction
-Predicts Customer Lifetime Value using Gamma-Gamma & Beta-Geometric models and Machine Learning (XGBoost, Random Forest).
-Feature engineering includes transaction frequency, order value trends, and churn probability estimates.
-Techniques: Lifetimes Python Library, Regression Models, Bayesian Statistics.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Churn Prediction
-Develops a Supervised Learning model to identify customers likely to churn.
-Compares Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) for performance.
-Evaluates model performance using ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, and F1-score metrics.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Predicting Next Purchase Day
-Uses Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet) to predict when a customer will make their next purchase.
-Incorporates seasonality decomposition, lag features, and rolling statistics for better forecasting.
-Techniques: Statsmodels, Facebook Prophet, TensorFlow (LSTM).

6Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Prediction
-Implements Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for predicting future sales trends.
-Handles data imbalances, missing values, and outliers to improve model accuracy.
-Techniques: Time Series Analysis, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Market Response Models
-Builds econometric models to evaluate the impact of marketing efforts on revenue.
-Implements Multivariate Regression, Marketing Mix Models (MMM), and Price Elasticity Models.
-Techniques: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Uplift Modeling
-Implements Causal Inference and Uplift Modeling to measure the impact of marketing campaigns.
-Compares Two-Model Approach, KL Divergence, and Tree-Based Uplift Models.
-Techniques: EconML, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Treatment Effect Estimation.

9Ô∏è‚É£ A/B Testing Design & Execution
-Designs and analyzes controlled experiments (A/B, Multivariate, Sequential Testing).
-Uses Bayesian vs Frequentist methods to compare test groups.
-Evaluates statistical significance (p-values, confidence intervals, effect sizes).
-Techniques: SciPy, Statsmodels, Bayesian Inference (PyMC3).
